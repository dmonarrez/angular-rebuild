# Zillow Angular Rebuild

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Getting Started

* Clone from https://github.com/dmonarrez/angular-rebuild
* Find the file in your terminal and run `$ npm install` to get required packages

## Description

This project is a light rebuild of the Zillow webpage using Angular CLI to get practice building out pages and apps with Angular. This project also utilizes Firebase as a database and as a method of deployment.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

The program still needs more aspects fleshed out nearly identical to the Zillow site.
The program still has yet to be linked up to firebase for data storage and deployment.
